        <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/">Department of Political Science and International Relations</a> at the <a href="http://www.unige.ch/">University of Geneva</a>. After predoctoral research stays in the <a href="http://politics.as.nyu.edu/page/home">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a> and the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/politics/">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/">Princeton University</a>, I received my PhD from the <a href="http://www.unige.ch/">University of Geneva</a> in 2016.</p>
        <p>My primary research interests include legislative behavior, political representation, and quantitative methods. In my dissertation, I develop theoretical and empirical models to examine under what circumstances roll call votes occur in legislatures and how the use of such votes affects the voting behavior of legislators. To read more about my work, see <a href="research.html">Research</a>. Please feel free to contact me for more information.</p>
