        I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/">Department of Political Science and International Relations</a> at the <a href="http://www.unige.ch/">University of Geneva</a>. After predoctoral research stays in the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/politics/">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/">Princeton University</a> and the <a href="http://politics.as.nyu.edu/page/home">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, I received my PhD from the <a href="http://www.unige.ch/">University of Geneva</a> in 2016.

        My primary research interests include legislative behavior, political representation, and quantitative methods. In my dissertation, I developed theoretical and empirical models to explore the reasons for and consequences of roll-call voting in legislatures. To read more about my work, see the Projects menu.
